## üß† Contribution Rules

### ‚úÖ General Guidelines

- Do **not** mix project-specific logic here ‚Äî this package is meant to be **general-purpose and reusable**.
- All names should be clear, lowercase, and snake_case.
- Document any new logic with a short comment above it.

## üéØ `choices.py` Guidelines

> Central place for reusable field choices (e.g. gender, user type, product size, media type, etc.)

### ‚úÖ RULES for Adding New Choices

1. **Append new choices at the end** of the list.
   - ‚úÖ Good:
     ```python
     MEDIA_TYPE_CHOICES = [
         ('image', 'Image'),
         ('video', 'Video'),
         ('audio', 'Audio'),
         ('document', 'Document'),
         ('pdf', 'PDF'),  # added at the end
         ('other', 'Other'),
     ]
     ```

   - ‚ùå BAD:
     ```python
     MEDIA_TYPE_CHOICES = [
         ('pdf', 'PDF'),  # ‚ùå Do not put new types first!
         ('image', 'Image'),
         ...
     ]
     ```

2. This avoids breaking any code that relies on fixed ordering like:
   ```python
   media_type = MEDIA_TYPE_CHOICES[0][0]  # Assumes 'image'
